# AWS SaaS Sales Analysis
# About
This project is a part of **JCDS Program : Purwadhika**. This Repository contains file Python Notebook for my Analyze about this Case Study.
This project contains the results of my analysis regarding AWS SaaS Sales, a Fictional SaaS Company from January 2020 - December 2023.

## Business Task
How can a company still get high profits but still get loyalty from customers and analyze the influence of customer background on their purchasing habits and make adjustments to the company's business strategy according to historical sales data to customers.

> **Objective** : To clean, analyze and visualize the data to observe how Customer habits, business background and location can influence a company's ability to make a profit.

## Business Problem
1. Does the amount of the discount given affect profits?
2. Information regarding the customer's company affects the profits obtained by our company.
3. Analyze differences in customer backgrounds that affect profits in our company.
4. What is the time period experienced by our company that has significant profit?
5. What are our recommendations for future sales strategies that will provide high profits to the company.

## Summary & Recommendation
**Summary :**
1. The amount of the discount given turns out to influence profit negatively, although the magnitude of the influence is not that strong (meaning: the higher the discount given, the profit will decrease). <br>

2. Information related to **`Location`** of the customer's company also influences the amount of profit we receive, the details are as follows: <br>
- Customers from each region apparently provide different profits from other regions, in this case the **EMEA** region is ranked first for generating the highest profit from purchasing our products, followed by the **AMER** and **APJ* regions *, the country that gives us the most profit is the USA, followed by the UK in second place, for Profit by City it is still dominated by cities from Europe. Likewise, the number of transactions is still dominated by the **EMEA** region.

3. Business Background: Customers also provide different Total Profits, the details are as follows:<br>
- The highest profits we get come from companies that have the **SMB/Small-Medium Business** segmentation, followed by the **Strategic** segmentation and finally **Enterprise**. The total proportion of transactions that have been made previously is still dominated by the **SMB** segmentation, this means a good sign for our product in the eyes of companies with this segmentation. With the high demand for our products by customers with this segmentation, it also provides high profits for the company. <br>
- Companies operating in the 'Finance' sector also provide high profits to our company, followed by companies from the 'Energy' and 'Manufacturing' industries.
- Our Top 10 customers in terms of highest profits are dominated by those in the **SMB** segmentation and from the **Finance, Energy, Manufacturing and ConsumerProduct** industries.

4. Our sales and profit trends have tended to increase over the last 4 years. The time span that provides quite extreme profit significance is 2020, being the year with the lowest profit over the last 4 years and the most significant increase per year occurred between 2021-2022 with an increase of up to **200,000$**, and for the month range there was a decrease significant increase in December 2020 - January 2021 and a significant increase in November 2022 - December 2022.

5. Our Best Product is: **Alchemy** and our Worst Product is: **Marketing Suite**

6. 50% of our products provide negative profits if the discount amount given is not correct.

7. Giving discounts exceeding 50% gives us quite large losses.

**Recommendation :**

1. Optimizing the provision of discounts according to the amount based on the profit received by the company will be very profitable for the company. This discount can also be given to potential customers to grow *customer loyalty* in them.

2. Focus our target market on customers from Top Regions and Top Countries, and give them offers that are based on the profits we get.

3. Carry out strong penetration in sales of our products to companies with segmentation that has the potential to increase company profits.

4. Providing discount offers to companies operating in the Finance, Energy and Manufacturing Industries on our potential products related to their industry.

5. Maintaining the stability of sales of our potential products by providing appropriate discounts according to provisions based on company profits, with the aim of increasing transactions on behalf of this product.

6. Reviewing our Worst Products so that we can then provide new marketing strategies to increase sales of this product, giving discounts on this product can still be done but with the right conditions.

7. Providing new marketing strategies that will be established in countries/cities with low total transactions and profits.

8. Products in the safe category (profit based on discounts) can be given discounts of a measurable amount.

9. Products in the risk category (profit based on discounts) can be sold at normal prices within a certain period of time.

10. Carrying out reviews per certain time period to ensure the old strategy is still successful and ensure the new strategy can be implemented.
